question 3:Answer this question: What happens if you create a button to run ClearWorksheet() on the DQ worksheet? 

    we created a similar subroutine ClearWorksheet() so we cant not create a same name for multiple subroutines,  
 
 question 4:Create a button to run ClearWorksheet() on the DQ worksheet. Does its behavior match what you thought would happen?   
    
    To clear DQanalysis sheet,  I created a Sub routine called  clearDqanalysis()  so that the vba wont give us error. for each sheet created seperate subroutines to clear to avoid errors
